# react-native-beacons-manager

![logo](./images/RN-iBeacon.png)

`react-native-beacons-manager`: add beacon technology in your React Native application for both iOS and Android.

This repository is born to keep alive and up to date these 2 original awesome:
- [ibeacon for android](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-beacons-android)
- [ibeacon for iOS](https://github.com/frostney/react-native-ibeacon)

If you want to know more about just have a look at [my medium article](https://medium.com/@erwan.datin/mmazzarolohow-to-play-with-ibeacons-in-a-react-native-application-5cef754b2edc#.e2bvgplvy).

## Install (iOS and Android)

> Ensure to have NodeJS >= v6.x.
>
> You must run on **real devices** (*don't forget to active Bluetooth when running*).

**Mobile Version compatibility:**

> - **iOS** `minimum version`
>   -  8.0
> - **Android** `minimum version`
>   - 21 (*alias LOLLIPOP*)


### 1. get modules
*via npm:*
```javascript:
npm install react-native-beacons-manager
```
*or via yarn:*
```javascript:
yarn add react-native-beacons-manager
```
### 2. link to your application

```javascript
react-native link react-native-beacons-manager
```
### 3.a configuration specific to iOS

If you plan to:
- `only range beacons` no configuration needed (`react-native init` already did the job for you), or just check that you already have `WhenInUse` authorization declared in your `info.plist`:
  - ![ios: request when in use authorization](./images/plistRequireWhenInUseAutorization.png)


- `monitor` then default authorization won't be enough:
  - in your `info.plist`, add `Privacy - Location Always Usage Description` key defined (*empty value or not. It is better to define a value to a custom / more user-friendly message*).
  ![ios: request when in use authorization](./images/plistRequireAlwaysUseAutorization.png)

-  If your `Info.plist` contains a `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` key, you have to specify an associated text to avoid being rejected.

- **use background mode** check [this documentation](./BACKGROUND_MODES.md)

### 3.b configuration specific to Android

Nothing (lucky Android :smile:).

Just don't forget to activate
- Bluetooth service (*all android version*)
- Location service (*android < 7: beacon detection won't work on android 6 if location service is off*)

## 4 usage

>NOTE: If simple examples below don't help you as much as you wanted, [check detailed documentation depending on use-case + code samples here](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/tree/master/examples/samples#detailed-documentation--sample-code)

### 4.a iOS

#### Simple example

```javascript
import { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native'
import Beacons from 'react-native-beacons-manager'

// Define a region which can be identifier + uuid,
// identifier + uuid + major or identifier + uuid + major + minor
// (minor and major properties are numbers)
const region = {
    identifier: 'Estimotes',
    uuid: 'B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D'
};

// Request for authorization while the app is open
Beacons.requestWhenInUseAuthorization();

Beacons.startMonitoringForRegion(region);
Beacons.startRangingBeaconsInRegion(region);

Beacons.startUpdatingLocation();

// Listen for beacon changes
const subscription = DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(
  'beaconsDidRange',
  (data) => {
    // data.region - The current region
    // data.region.identifier
    // data.region.uuid

    // data.beacons - Array of all beacons inside a region
    //  in the following structure:
    //    .uuid
    //    .major - The major version of a beacon
    //    .minor - The minor version of a beacon
    //    .rssi - Signal strength: RSSI value (between -100 and 0)
    //    .proximity - Proximity value, can either be "unknown", "far", "near" or "immediate"
    //    .accuracy - The accuracy of a beacon
  }
);
```

| **requestWhenInUseAuthorization** | This method should be called before anything else is called. It handles to request the use of beacons while the application is open. If the application is in the background, you will not get a signal from beacons. Either this method or `Beacons.requestAlwaysAuthorization` needs to be called to receive data from beacons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **requestAlwaysAuthorization**    | This method should be called before anything else is called. It handles to request the use of beacons while the application is open or in the background. Either this method or `Beacons.requestWhenInUseAuthorization` needs to be called to receive data from beacons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **getAuthorizationStatus**        | This methods gets the current authorization status. While this methods provides a callback, it is not executed asynchronously. The values `authorizedAlways` and `authorizedWhenInUse` correspond to the methods `requestWhenInUseAuthorization` and `requestAlwaysAuthorization` respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **startMonitoringForRegion**      | When starting monitoring for beacons, we need to define a region as the parameter. The `region` is an object, which needs to have at least two values: `identifier` and `uuid`. Additionally, it can also have a `major`, `minor` version or both. Make sure to not re-use the same identifier. In that case, we won't get the data for the beacons. The corresponding events are `regionDidEnter` and `regionDidExit`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **startRangingBeaconsInRegion**   | When ranging for beacons, we need to define a `region` as the parameter. The `region` is an object, which needs to have at least two values: `identifier` and `uuid`. Additionally, it can also have a `major`, `minor` version or both. Make sure to not re-use the same identifier. In that case, we won't get the data for the beacons. The corresponding events are `beaconsDidRange`. The event will fire in every interval the beacon sends a signal, which is one second in most cases. If we are monitoring and ranging for beacons, it is best to first call `startMonitoringForRegion` and then call `startRangingBeaconsInRegion`. |
| **startUpdatingLocation**         | This call is needed for monitoring beacons and gets the initial position of the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **stopUpdatingLocation**          | This method should be called when you don't need to receive location-based information and want to save battery power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **shouldDropEmptyRanges**         | Call this method to stop sending the `beaconsDidRange` event when the beacon list is empty. This can be useful when listening to multiple beacon regions and can reduce cpu usage by 1-1.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **authorizationStatusDidChange** | This event will be called when authorization changed for receiving data location. PLEASE NOTE: starting a location service will not provide data location until authorization is given by the user ("authorizedAlways" or "authorizedWhenInUse").                                                                                               |
| **beaconsDidRange**              | This event will be called for every region in every beacon interval. If you have three regions you get three events every second (which is the default interval beacons send their signal). When we take a closer look at the parameter of the callback, we get information on both the region and the beacons.                                 |
| **regionDidEnter**               | If the device entered a region, `regionDidEnter` is being called. Inside the callback the parameter we can use returns an object with a property `region` that contains the `region` identifier value as a string. Additionally, we get the UUID of the region through its `uuid` property.                                                     |
| **regionDidExit**                | In the same `regionDidEnter` is called if the device entered a region, `regionDidExit` will be called if the device exited a region and we can't get any signal from any of the beacons inside the region. As for the payload, we get a property called `region` that represents the `region` identifier and is a string as well as the `uuid`. |
| **authorizationDidChange**       | When the user permissions change, for example the user allows to always use beacons, this event will be called. The same applies when the user revokes the permission to use beacons. The payload is a string which can either be: `"authorizedAlways"`, `"authorizedWhenInUse"`, `"denied"`, `"notDetermined"` or `"restricted"`               |


### 4.b Android

#### Simple example

```javascript
import { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native'
import Beacons from 'react-native-beacons-manager'

// Tells the library to detect iBeacons
Beacons.detectIBeacons()

// Start detecting all iBeacons in the nearby
try {
  await Beacons.startRangingBeaconsInRegion('REGION1')
  console.log(`Beacons ranging started succesfully!`)
} catch (err) {
  console.log(`Beacons ranging not started, error: ${error}`)
}

// Print a log of the detected iBeacons (1 per second)
DeviceEventEmitter.addListener('beaconsDidRange', (data) => {
  console.log('Found beacons!', data.beacons)
})
```

| **startMonitoringForRegion({identifier: string, uuid: string, minor: int, major: int}): promise** | Starts monitoring for beacons. The parameter `identifier` must be an unique ID. The parameter uuid is optional, it allows you to detect only the beacons with a specific UUID (if `null` every beacon will be detected). The parameters `minor` and `major` are optional, they allow you to monitor only the region of a specific beacon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **startRangingBeaconsInRegion(regionId: string, beaconsUUID: string): promise**                   | Starts range scan for beacons. The parameter `regionId` must be an unique ID. The parameter `beaconsUUID` is optional, it allows you to detect only the beacons with a specific UUID (if `null` every beacon will be detected).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## TODO:
**Standardization of iOS and android to make library more coherent:**

- **iOS**
  - [x] `startRangingBeaconsInRegion` and `startMonitoringForRegion` should return promises like android

- **android**
  - [x] `startRangingBeaconsInRegion` should accept an object like iOS and other methods (won't prevent from accepting current parameters: not to break existing)

**Improvements or new feature:**

- **iOS**
  - [ ] add support to Eddystone
- **android**
  - [x] add support to Eddystone
